    <description>Command Line GUI includes a command line arguments parser library Fonlow.CommandLineGui.Core.dll for constructing .NET command line programs with complex arguments.

You define a data model class decorated by some attributes for representing arguments. The core library will parse the command line arguments and populate the Plain Old CLR Object which is the router of the functionality of your command line program. And the Core library may also generates CLI help page as illustrated in https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/proj/commandlinegui/screenshots/Standard.PNG/182/137 

Command Line GUI is a host program that generates GUI for existing command line programs. .NET command line programs constructed through the core library could become a plugin of Command Line GUI and have the GUI generated. 

You may use the core library to wrap existing command line programs like Robocopy, and the wrapper may become a plugin, thus a native command line program could easily have a GUI.
